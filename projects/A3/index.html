			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch I wanted to explore an affective objective of delineating the overall 
                    growth of population and imply its environmental implications.</li>
				<li>I was hoping it will communicate how the population is growing tremendously and 100 years 
                    may seem like much, but it isn’t - it’s the span of 4 generations, a time span we 
                    can easily track if we think of family members</li>
				<li>The Y axis flip I think work well, as well as the annotations. There is a problem with the 
                    magnitude of the “sacks” because although they reach the correct bar in terms of their length, 
                    in terms of area the relation between 1900 and 2000 age populations break (it seems like there 
                    are 10 more 45 years old in 2000 than in 1900, when there are actually only less than double). 
                    It serves the affective objective but can be misleading. Similarly, the points are not counted and not 
                    actually correlate to real numbers.
                </li>
                <li>In the next sketch I want to explore using the gender data in the table
                </li>
			</ul>

          Gender Distribution Pie Charts
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch I wanted to look at the distribution of males and females over 
                    the years and see if there has been a substantial change from 1900 to 2000 
                    (especially for older ages, as life expectancy increased)
                </li>
				<li>I think the pie charts work well with the legend and it’s pretty clear, 
                    also the cartoons help understand the distribution according to age. 
                    However, it’s not very engaging.
                </li>
				<li>In the next sketch I want to try a traditional method of showing age distribution 
                    between male and female in the overall population and see if I can “hack” it in 
                    more subtle methods.</li>
			</ul>

                    Bar Charts Sketch - Age Distribution
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch I tried to illustrate the increase in life expectancy 
                    between 1900 and 2000, as well as embracing a more cognitive objective, 
                    of laying out the data and keeping an open mind for exploration.</li>
				<li> hoped to realize something new from the visualization and I realized we can see how the picks of lives have changed, making the different life periods move between ages. What was the prime of your career in 1900, is probably just the beginning of adult life in 2000.
                </li>
				<li>I think the bar chart that goes to the right and left (dual x axis? With two positive directions) is working well. The annotations can be netter designed to explain the above mentioned realization. 
                </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I think the first and last sketches are the most interesting ones to explore further. The first is interesting from an affective and design perspective, while the bars chart is more interesting from a cognitive objective perspective. The pie charts sketch is revealing very little new or interesting information and from a design perspective it’s pretty basic. I think it falls into the “junk chart” category. For the next phase I think the most interesting will be to develop the first  sketch and see how it’ll work with more refined dimensions and adjusted X axis (with regular intervals).

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        
	Designing this visualization, my intention was to narrate the significant growth in population over a century and suggest the potential environmental consequences of this expansion. The design is meant to illustrate not just the increase in numbers but to connect it to a concept that resonates on a personal level—the idea of family generations. The comparison between 1900 and 2000 is encapsulated in the metaphor of 'sacks' filled with points, each representing demographic data. This metaphor aims to evoke the weight of the population increase and its metaphorical burden on the earth's resources.
      </p>
<p>In terms of visual encodings, I chose the sack shape to convey population data, with the size of each sack corresponding to the number of individuals in an age group. The color-coding—pink for the 1900 data and blue for 2000—was selected to differentiate clearly between the two time periods at a glance. Inverting the Y-axis was a deliberate choice to visually support the metaphor of weight, suggesting the idea of population figures as a load to be supported. This decision also subverts the typical association of 'up' with 'growth,' prompting the viewer to think differently about population increases.</p>
<p>However, I acknowledge that this metaphorical approach could potentially mislead the viewer. The size of the sacks, while visually striking, may not accurately represent the proportional differences in population sizes between the two years. Additionally, the individual points inside the sacks do not correspond to exact figures, which was a sacrifice I made for the sake of visual impact over precision.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>Reflecting on the initial sketching phase, it's clear that it was influential in the development of my final design. The inverted Y-axis and annotations were ideas that I retained from my initial sketches. The sketching phase also highlighted the potential misrepresentation of data through the sack metaphor, yet I chose to maintain this approach in the final design. I did so with the understanding that while the sacks might not convey exact numbers, they serve the larger narrative I aimed to tell. In retrospect, sketching was a valuable step that helped me explore creative ways to represent data, and while it revealed some limitations of my initial ideas, it also solidified my commitment to an affective, metaphor-driven approach.
